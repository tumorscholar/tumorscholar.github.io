### **Research Skills**

#### **Cell Culture Techniques**
- **2D Culture**: Skilled in the maintenance and manipulation of human cell lines, including drug treatment, cell viability assays, transfection, viral transduction, stable clone generation, immunofluorescence assays, migration and wound healing assays.  
- **3D Culture**: Experienced in generating spheroids and organoids, isolating and culturing immune cells, and establishing organoid–immune cell co-culture systems.

#### **Molecular Biology**
- Proficient in DNA and RNA isolation from blood, frozen, and FFPE tissues.
- Techniques include mutation screening, denaturing urea PAGE, formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis, reverse transcription, quantitative PCR (qPCR), molecular cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and luciferase reporter assays.

#### **Protein Biology**
- Experienced in protein extraction and purification, dialysis, SDS and native PAGE, and Western blotting for protein analysis.

#### **Tumour Tissue Processing**
- Proficient in macro-dissection of tumour epithelium, preparation of FFPE blocks, tissue sectioning, haematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E), immunohistochemistry, micro-dissection for DNA isolation, and primary tumour-derived cell line generation.

#### **Genomics and Data Analysis**
- Hands-on experience with array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression microarrays.
- Competent in R programming for data preprocessing, normalization, clustering, CMS, SAM, and GSEA.
- Skilled in using online tools and databases such as cBioPortal, Enrichr, UCSC Genome Browser (ENCODE), Gene Ontology, and WebGestalt.

#### **Single-Cell Sequencing and Analysis**
- Proficient in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), CITE-seq, and TCR-seq data analysis using R and Python.

#### **Biostatistics and Epidemiology**
- Trained in clinical study design, collection and analysis of clinicopathological and survival data, hypothesis testing, and data visualization.

#### **Infection Biology**
- Hands-on experience in culturing clinical isolates of *Leishmania donovani*, infecting human cell lines, and performing related assays including DNA fragmentation, Giemsa staining, CFSE and PI staining.
- Trained in Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) facility for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

#### **Microscopy**
- Proficient in brightfield, phase-contrast, fluorescence, confocal, and multiplex tissue imaging.
- Demonstrations completed in Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and super-resolution microscopy.

#### **Model Organisms**
- Experienced in dissection and handling of BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J mice.
- Familiar with *Drosophila melanogaster* techniques through advanced training.
- Certified in “Basics of Mouse Genetics” and “Introduction to CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre-lox Technologies” from The Jackson Laboratory, USA.
