**Omics**\
Proficient in sample preparation for whole exome seq, bulk RNA seq, single-cell RNA-seq, CITE-seq, and TCR-seq and its data analysis using R and Python.

**Microscopy**\
Well seasoned in brightfield, phase-contrast, fluorescence, confocal, and multiplex tissue imaging. Experienced in Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and super-resolution microscopy.

**Tissue Processing**\
Expert in macro-dissection of tumour epithelium, preparation of FFPE blocks, tissue sectioning, haematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E), immunohistochemistry, micro-dissection of epithelial tissue for DNA isolation, and primary tumour-derived cell line generation.

**3D Cell Culture**\
Experienced in generating spheroids and organoids, isolating and culturing immune cells, and establishing organoid–immune cell co-culture systems.

**2D Cell Culture**\
Skilled in the maintenance and manipulation of human cell lines, including drug treatment, cell viability assays, transfection, viral transduction, stable clone generation, immunofluorescence assays, migration and wound healing assays.  

**Microarray**\
Hands-on experience with array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression microarrays. Competent in R programming for data preprocessing, normalization, clustering, CMS, SAM, and GSEA. Skilled in using online tools and databases such as cBioPortal, Enrichr, UCSC Genome Browser (ENCODE), Gene Ontology, and WebGestalt.

**Molecular Biology**\
Proficient in DNA and RNA isolation from blood, frozen, and FFPE tissues; and in techniques like mutation screening, denaturing urea PAGE, formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis, reverse transcription, quantitative PCR (qPCR), molecular cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and luciferase reporter assays.

**Protein Biology**\
Experienced in protein extraction and purification, dialysis, SDS and native PAGE, and Western blotting for protein analysis.

**Infection Biology**\
Hands-on experience in culturing clinical isolates of *Leishmania donovani*, infecting human cell lines, and performing related assays including DNA fragmentation, Giemsa staining, CFSE and PI staining.
Trained in Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) facility for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

**Model Organisms**\
Experienced in dissection and handling of BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J mice.
Familiar with *Drosophila melanogaster* techniques through advanced training.
Certified in “Basics of Mouse Genetics” and “Introduction to CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre-lox Technologies” from The Jackson Laboratory, USA.

**Biostatistics and Epidemiology**\
Trained in clinical study design, collection and analysis of clinicopathological and survival data, hypothesis testing, and data visualization.
