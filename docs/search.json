    "text": "Hello everyone!\nI am a postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of immunology and metabolism, with a focus on T cell-mediated responses in Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is a niche but rapidly advancing field where immune-metabolic crosstalk is reshaping how we understand chronic diseases. My work explores how immune cells communicate across tissues like liver and adipose, uncovering pathways that drive inflammation and fibrosis in MASLD.\nMy scientific journey began in India, rooted in cancer biology, and has since led me to London, where I now investigate clinical immunology using human samples and multiomics technologies. Along the way, I have come to appreciate that science isn’t just about conducting experiments - It is also about communicating, questioning, and connecting.\nAs someone who bridges both wet-lab experiments and computational analysis, I constantly find myself shifting between minute technical decisions - like optimising antibody staining or choosing clustering parameters in Seurat - and broader conceptual questions about immune regulation and disease progression. That duality is exciting but also mentally taxing, and in the chaos of experiments and deadlines, I kept telling myself I had start this blog “soon.”\nTruth is, I have been procrastinating on writing this for a long time. Not because I didn’t want to - but because like many postdocs, I often felt too stretched, too unsure, or too perfectionistic to start. Between visa renewals, publication pressure, and the sheer unpredictability of working with human samples, finding time (and mental space) to write for myself felt like a luxury.\nBut I have come to realise that writing doesn’t have to wait for perfect clarity. In fact, this blog is an attempt to bring clarity through writing - A personal and professional space to document what I am learning, reflect on the messy parts of science, and share insights that might resonate with others walking a similar path.\n\n\n\nImage: My research depiction created using OpenAI tools\n\n\nHere, you can expect posts that touch on topics close to my work:\n\n\nT cells in tissue inflammation and fibrosis\n\n\nSingle-cell data analysis\n\n\nHuman immunopathology in the context of liver disease\n\n\nComputational tools I have found useful (and those I am still wrestling with)\n\n\nReflections on the postdoc experience, perspective of an international researcher\n\n\nThis space will not be just a summary of what I have figured out - It will be a living archive of things I didn’t even realise I knew until I had to explain them. If you are someone who lives between code and cell culture, between curiosity and imposter syndrome - welcome aboard.\nLet us explore science not only as a discipline but as a dialogue."

    "title": "From Prometheus to P450: Why the Liver Deserves Our Attention",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Hello everyone!\nWelcome to my blog 🎉\nToday, I want to shift the focus slightly not away from science, but deeper into one of the organs at the heart of it all: the liver.\nThe liver is one of the most vital, complex, and fascinating organs in the human body. It processes everything we eat or drink, filters toxins, stores energy, regulates immunity, and can regenerate itself like no other organ. Despite all this, the liver often remains in the scientific and public shadow. But not always: ancient cultures recognised its power in ways modern medicine is only beginning to understand. This post explores the rich interplay of liver mythology, biology, and modern science: Prometheus’s eternal punishment to today’s fight against metabolic liver disease.\nThe Liver in Ancient Belief and Myth\n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, around 2000 BCE, priests practiced hepatoscopy, a ritual of divination using the livers of sacrificed animals, most commonly sheep. They believed the liver held divine messages, and clay models, such as the Babylonian Liver Tablet from Nineveh, were used to train diviners in interpreting these sacred signs.\n\nAcross the Mediterranean, the liver played a symbolic role in Greek mythology. In the tales of Prometheus, as told by Hesiod and Aeschylus, the Titan was condemned by Zeus to have his liver eaten daily by an eagle, only for it to regenerate overnight, A myth that surprisingly mirrors the liver’s real regenerative abilities.\n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine, the liver is more than a physical organ; it governs the flow of Qi (vital energy), influences emotional well-being, particularly anger, and supports decision-making and spiritual balance.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ayurveda, the ancient medical system of India, the liver is linked with the Pitta dosha, which oversees digestion, metabolism, and transformation. Ayurvedic practitioners have long used herbs like Kutki and Kalmegh to promote liver health and restore balance.\n\nThese traditions, spanning continents and millennia, highlight how cultures across time intuitively recognized the liver’s central importance to life, healing, and even cosmic order.\nThe Biological Marvel of the Liver\n\nThe liver is often described as the body’s metabolic hub due to its central role in processing nutrients and maintaining biochemical homeostasis. After a meal, nutrients absorbed from the gut enter the liver through the portal vein. Here, the liver converts glucose into glycogen for short-term energy storage, synthesises vital proteins such as albumin and clotting factors, and plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism (breaking down) and distributing fats or storing them as needed. It also regulates amino acid levels and produces cholesterol, which is essential for hormone synthesis and cell membranes.\n\nBeyond metabolism, the liver serves as the body’s primary detoxification organ. It breaks down potentially harmful substances including alcohol, environmental toxins, and many pharmaceutical drugs. This detoxification largely occurs through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which modifies lipophilic compounds to make them more water-soluble and easier to excrete. These chemical transformations are essential in preventing the accumulation of toxic substances in the body.\n\nAnother vital function of the liver is bile production. Bile is a greenish fluid that helps emulsify dietary fats in the small intestine, allowing for their digestion and absorption. It also aids in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K. Bile is stored in the gallbladder and released into the duodenum in response to food intake, especially fatty meals. This multifaceted role of the liver: As a metabolic processor, chemical purifier, and digestive partner, underlines its importance in nearly every aspect of human physiology.\n\nOne of the most remarkable features of the liver is its ability to regenerate. Unlike most organs, the liver can restore its original size and function even after substantial tissue loss up to 70% in some cases. This regenerative capacity is not simply about cell replacement but involves a finely tuned response of hepatocytes (the main liver cells), supported by non-parenchymal cells such as Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and endothelial cells. Following injury or partial removal (as in liver surgery or transplantation), a cascade of molecular signals,growth factors, cytokines, and metabolic cues-triggers the proliferation of existing liver cells rather than relying on stem cell populations. This regenerative process ensures the rapid restoration of liver mass and function while maintaining its complex architecture.\n\nThe myth of Prometheus, whose liver regrew daily after being devoured, turns out to echo a biological truth long before it was understood scientifically. This unique ability makes the liver not only resilient but also central to surgical and therapeutic approaches for liver disease.\n\nReflections: Why This Matters\nFrom divine organ to overlooked regulator, the liver deserves renewed attention. Its central role in metabolism, immunity, and chronic disease progression makes it not just a scientific challenge, but a public health priority. As someone from India now working in London on T cell-driven liver disease, I see this blog post as a bridge between ancient reverence and modern research, between regional need and global science.\n\nThe liver isn’t just about detox. It’s about balance, resilience, and transformation: whether in myth or in medicine"

    "text": "Postdoctoral Researcher\nQueen Mary University of London, UK\nNovember 2022 – Present\nI am currently investigating the immunopathogenesis of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), with a focus on understanding the mechanistic links between innate and adaptive immune cells across anatomical compartments. In this project, we employ a multi-omics approach integrating CITE-seq and TCR/BCR-seq on CD45⁺ immune cells isolated from simultaneously collected liver, peripheral blood, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissues obtained during bariatric surgery. Furthermore, I perform high-dimensional spatial profiling using multiplex immunostaining (Cell DIVE™) on the same tissue specimens subjected to CITE-seq, enabling spatial validation and contextualisation of the single-cell transcriptomic data.\nPostdoctoral Researcher\nQueen Mary University of London, UK\nNovember 2020 – November 2022\nIn this role, I investigated the functional and spatial intra-tumour heterogeneity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), focusing on tumour–immune interactions that drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumour progression. We performed exome sequencing and deep immune phenotyping of early-stage lesions, invasive OSCC, and nodal metastases. In parallel, I established organoids from distinct anatomical regions of the mouse oral cavity and developed organoids-T cell co-culture models to study epithelial-immune cell interactions involving CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells.\nPostdoctoral Researcher\nCentre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), India\nOctober 2018 – November 2020\nI collaborated with pathologists to profile the immune landscape of rectal cancer through histological techniques including H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, and image analysis. In parallel, I contributed to characterising the gene fusion landscape in colorectal cancer by performing in silico functional analyses using bioinformatics tools. Shortlisted fusion candidates were subsequently validated through PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, cloning, and in vitro functional assays.\nAdditionally, my research focused on elucidating the regulatory role of ARID1B, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, in transcriptional control via enhancer–promoter looping. I employed ARID1B pull-down assays followed by mass spectrometry to identify interacting partners, and validated key enhancer–promoter interactions using ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-loop techniques.\nDoctoral Researcher\nCentre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), India\nJuly 2012 – October 2018\nMy Ph.D. research focused on characterising unique molecular subtypes of early-onset sporadic rectal cancer (EOSRC), particularly cases lacking canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, which is prevalent in over half of Indian patients with EOSRC. Using gene expression microarrays, I compared Wnt-negative and Wnt-positive tumours and identified: (a) Enrichment of Ca²⁺/NFAT signalling in Wnt-negative tumours (b) An eight-gene transcriptional signature distinguishing Wnt-positive from Wnt-negative tumours (c) XPNPEP3 as a novel transcriptional target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.\nMaster’s Research Project\nUniversity of Hyderabad, India\nAugust 2010 – July 2012\nI conducted a one-year dissertation project on the mechanisms of drug resistance in Leishmania donovani, focusing on Amphotericin B resistance in the amastigote stage. I identified differential isoform expression of S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine: C-24-Δ-Sterol Methyltransferase (SCMT) between wild-type and resistant strains.\nUndergraduate Research Training\nMagadh University, India\nAugust 2007 – June 2010\nDuring my bachelor’s studies, I undertook summer research training each year:\n2010 – Cancer Biology, Mahavir Cancer Institute & Research Centre, India.\nGained hands-on experience in preparing FFPE blocks, H&E staining, and microscopic evaluation of histopathological sections.\n2009 – Immunological Techniques, Path Laboratory, India.\nTrained in blood separation, lymphocyte and PMN isolation, agglutination assays, and blood group typing.\n2008 – Clinical Pathology, Patna Medical College and Hospital, India.\nLearned differential blood cell identification and various biochemical assays, including CRP, ESR, glucose, and hormone level assessments."
