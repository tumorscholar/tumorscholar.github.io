    "text": "I am an enterprising biomedical research scientist dedicated to dissect the roles of T cell in disease outcomes. My current research focuses on understanding T cells involvement in the liver, adipose tissues, and blood of patients with early-stage liver fibrosis. Through this work, I aim to advance our understanding of the early-stage liver fibrosis drivers and contribute to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies."

After earning my Master’s degree in Animal Biotechnology from the University of Hyderabad, I completed my PhD at the Center for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Hyderabad, where I worked on early-onset sporadic rectal cancer (EOSRC) for my thesis. During this time, I developed an interest in T-cell mediated immunopathogenesis.\nCurrently, I am investigating the pathogenesis of Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). I am characterizing the T cell repertoire and its response in MASH using single-cell sequencing (CITEseq and TCRseq) of immune cells isolated simultaneously from the liver, blood, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissues in a cohort of mild to moderate MASH patients.\nBeyond the lab, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm for science with students and people in various communities."
