    "text": "I am a multidisciplinary researcher with expertise in both wet lab and computational techniques, working extensively in the processing and analysis of human clinical samples.\nI was born in a small village in Bihar, India. My research journey began during my bachelor’s studies at Anugrah Narayan College, Patna, where I formed lasting friendships and developed a keen interest in science. Together with friends, I embarked on Master’s degree in Animal Biotechnology at the University of Hyderabad. It was during this time, inspired by the cutting-edge genomics facility at the School of Life Sciences, that I developed a strong interest in genomics.\nTo pursue my interest, I did PhD from the Laboratory of Molecular Oncology at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Hyderabad. My doctoral research focused on early-onset sporadic rectal cancer (EOSRC), where I developed a growing interest in organoids model and T cells mediated immunopathogenesis.\nFollowing my research at CDFD, I moved to Queen Mary University of London, where I followed my research interests and generated organoids from different regions of the mouse oral cavity and established Organoids – T cell co-culture systems.\nCurrently at Barts Liver Centre, I am investigating the immunopathogenesis of early-stage Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). My research focuses on profiling the T cell repertoire and its functional responses in early-stage MASH.\nBeyond the lab, I am deeply committed to science communication and education, and I actively engage with students and broader communities to share knowledge and inspire curiosity in biomedical science."

    "text": "Postdoctoral Researcher\nQueen Mary University of London, UK\nNovember 2022 – Present\nI am currently investigating the immunopathogenesis of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), with a focus on understanding the mechanistic links between innate and adaptive immune cells across anatomical compartments during progressive stages of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). In this project, we employ a multi-omics approach integrating CITE-seq and TCR-seq on CD45⁺ immune cells isolated from simultaneously collected liver, peripheral blood, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissues obtained during bariatric surgery. Furthermore, I perform high-dimensional spatial profiling using multiplex immunostaining (Cell DIVE™) on the same tissue specimens subjected to CITE-seq, enabling spatial validation and contextualisation of the single-cell transcriptomic data.\nPostdoctoral Researcher\nQueen Mary University of London, UK\nNovember 2020 – November 2022\nIn this role, I investigated the functional and spatial intra-tumour heterogeneity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), focusing on tumour–immune interactions that drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumour progression. We performed exome sequencing and deep immune phenotyping of early-stage lesions, invasive OSCC, and nodal metastases. In parallel, I established organoids from distinct anatomical regions of the mouse oral cavity and developed organoids-T cell co-culture models to study epithelial–immune cell interactions involving CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells.\nPostdoctoral Researcher\nCentre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), India\nOctober 2018 – November 2020\nI collaborated with pathologists to profile the immune landscape of rectal cancer through histological techniques including H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, and image analysis. In parallel, I contributed to characterising the gene fusion landscape in colorectal cancer by performing in silico functional analyses using bioinformatics tools. Shortlisted fusion candidates were subsequently validated through PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, cloning, and in vitro functional assays.\nAdditionally, my research focused on elucidating the regulatory role of ARID1B, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, in transcriptional control via enhancer–promoter looping. I employed ARID1B pull-down assays followed by mass spectrometry to identify interacting partners, and validated key enhancer–promoter interactions using ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-loop techniques.\nDoctoral Researcher\nCentre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), India\nJuly 2012 – October 2018\nMy Ph.D. research focused on characterising unique molecular subtypes of early-onset sporadic rectal cancer (EOSRC), particularly cases lacking canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, which is prevalent in over half of Indian patients with EOSRC. Using gene expression microarrays, I compared Wnt-negative and Wnt-positive tumours and identified: (a) Enrichment of Ca²⁺/NFAT signalling in Wnt-negative tumours (b) An eight-gene transcriptional signature distinguishing Wnt-positive from Wnt-negative tumours (c) XPNPEP3 as a novel transcriptional target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway\nMaster’s Research Project\nUniversity of Hyderabad, India\nAugust 2010 – July 2012\nI conducted a one-year dissertation project on the mechanisms of drug resistance in Leishmania donovani, focusing on Amphotericin B resistance in the amastigote stage. I identified differential isoform expression of S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine: C-24-Δ-Sterol Methyltransferase (SCMT) between wild-type and resistant strains.\nUndergraduate Research Training\nMagadh University, India\nAugust 2007 – June 2010\nDuring my bachelor’s studies, I undertook summer research training each year:\n2010 – Cancer Biology, Mahavir Cancer Institute & Research Centre, India.\nGained hands-on experience in preparing FFPE blocks, H&E staining, and microscopic evaluation of histopathological sections.\n2009 – Immunological Techniques, Path Laboratory, India.\nTrained in blood separation, lymphocyte and PMN isolation, agglutination assays, and blood group typing.\n2008 – Clinical Pathology, Patna Medical College and Hospital, India.\nLearned differential blood cell identification and various biochemical assays, including CRP, ESR, glucose, and hormone level assessments."
