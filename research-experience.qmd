**Postdoctoral Researcher**\
Queen Mary University of London, UK\
November 2022 – Present\
I am currently investigating the immunopathogenesis of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), with a focus on understanding the mechanistic links between innate and adaptive immune cells across anatomical compartments. In this project, we employ a multi-omics approach integrating CITE-seq and TCR-seq on CD45⁺ immune cells isolated from simultaneously collected liver, peripheral blood, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissues obtained during bariatric surgery. Furthermore, I perform high-dimensional spatial profiling using multiplex immunostaining (Cell DIVE™) on the same tissue specimens subjected to CITE-seq, enabling spatial validation and contextualisation of the single-cell transcriptomic data.

**Postdoctoral Researcher**\
Queen Mary University of London, UK\
November 2020 – November 2022\
In this role, I investigated the functional and spatial intra-tumour heterogeneity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), focusing on tumour–immune interactions that drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumour progression. We performed exome sequencing and deep immune phenotyping of early-stage lesions, invasive OSCC, and nodal metastases. In parallel, I established organoids from distinct anatomical regions of the mouse oral cavity and developed organoids-T cell co-culture models to study epithelial-immune cell interactions involving CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells.

Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), India\
October 2018 – November 2020\
I collaborated with pathologists to profile the immune landscape of rectal cancer through histological techniques including H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, and image analysis. In parallel, I contributed to characterising the gene fusion landscape in colorectal cancer by performing in silico functional analyses using bioinformatics tools. Shortlisted fusion candidates were subsequently validated through PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, cloning, and in vitro functional assays.\
Additionally, my research focused on elucidating the regulatory role of ARID1B, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, in transcriptional control via enhancer–promoter looping. I employed ARID1B pull-down assays followed by mass spectrometry to identify interacting partners, and validated key enhancer–promoter interactions using ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-loop techniques.

**Doctoral Researcher**\
Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), India\
July 2012 – October 2018\
My Ph.D. research focused on characterising unique molecular subtypes of early-onset sporadic rectal cancer (EOSRC), particularly cases lacking canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, which is prevalent in over half of Indian patients with EOSRC. Using gene expression microarrays, I compared Wnt-negative and Wnt-positive tumours and identified: (a) Enrichment of Ca²⁺/NFAT signalling in Wnt-negative tumours
(b) An eight-gene transcriptional signature distinguishing Wnt-positive from Wnt-negative tumours
(c) XPNPEP3 as a novel transcriptional target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

**Master’s Research Project**\
University of Hyderabad, India\
August 2010 – July 2012  
I conducted a one-year dissertation project on the mechanisms of drug resistance in Leishmania donovani, focusing on Amphotericin B resistance in the amastigote stage. I identified differential isoform expression of S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine: C-24-Δ-Sterol Methyltransferase (SCMT) between wild-type and resistant strains.

**Undergraduate Research Training**\
Magadh University, India\
August 2007 – June 2010 \
During my bachelor's studies, I undertook summer research training each year:\
2010 – Cancer Biology, Mahavir Cancer Institute & Research Centre, India.\
Gained hands-on experience in preparing FFPE blocks, H&E staining, and microscopic evaluation of histopathological sections.\
2009 – Immunological Techniques, Path Laboratory, India.\
Trained in blood separation, lymphocyte and PMN isolation, agglutination assays, and blood group typing.\
2008 – Clinical Pathology, Patna Medical College and Hospital, India.\
Learned differential blood cell identification and various biochemical assays, including CRP, ESR, glucose, and hormone level assessments.
