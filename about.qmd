::: justify-text
I am a multidisciplinary researcher with expertise in both wet lab and computational techniques, working extensively in the processing and analysis of human clinical samples.

I was born in a small village in Bihar, India. My research journey began during my bachelor's studies at Anugrah Narayan College, Patna, where I formed lasting friendships and developed a keen interest in science. Together with friends, I embarked on Master's degree in Animal Biotechnology at the University of Hyderabad. It was during this time, inspired by the cutting-edge genomics facility at the School of Life Sciences, that I developed a strong interest in genomics.

To pursue my interest, I did PhD from the Laboratory of Molecular Oncology at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Hyderabad. My doctoral research focused on early-onset sporadic rectal cancer (EOSRC), where I developed a growing interest in organoids model and T cells mediated immunopathogenesis.

Following my research at CDFD, I moved to Queen Mary University of London, where I followed my research interests and generated organoids from different regions of the mouse oral cavity and established Organoids â€“ T cell co-culture systems.

Currently at Barts Liver Centre, I am investigating the immunopathogenesis of early-stage Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). My research focuses on profiling the T cell repertoire and its functional responses in early-stage MASH.

Beyond the lab, I am deeply committed to science communication and education, and I actively engage with students and broader communities to share knowledge and inspire curiosity in biomedical science.
